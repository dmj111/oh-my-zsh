oh-my-zsh-custom
================

My custom directory for oh-my-zsh

Add this in place of the custom directory of oh-my-zsh for my personal
customizations.


### Git branch usage

- master is for tracking my copy of oh-my-zsh
- local is for my local files to a specific pc... not for pushing to
  git hub.


To update from oh-my-zsh:

- checkout master
- pull from oh-my-zsh
- (rebase instead?)
- checkout local
- rebase to master.
